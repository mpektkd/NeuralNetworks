### Lab 1: Supervised Learning
    - Part 1:
      - Classification Models on UCI Dataset
      - Optimization of the models
    - Part 2: 
      - MLP, SVM models on one of Kaggle's Datasets
      - Pipelines and optimizations process
      - Training technics e.g. cross-validation, early stopping
 

### Lab 2: Un-Supervised Learning
    - Part 1: Movies recommedation system based on content
    - Part 2: Semantic data visualization using SOM
    
### Lab 3: Deep Learning: Image Captioning
    (The code will be uploaded soon!)
